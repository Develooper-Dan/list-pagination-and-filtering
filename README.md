# Treehouse Techdegree:
# FSJS project 2 - List Filter and Pagination

The aim of this project was to use unobtrusive JavaScript on given fictive students lists
of varying length to add means of pagination and filtering to a HTML-Document without changing the actual
HTML. The HTML-Document as well as the .css were provided by Treehouse.

In more detail:
- The student list should only show a given number of students on a page at at time
- Page links had to be dynamically added to the page depending on the number of students
and the desired items shown per page. This function had to work with any number of list items.

To receive an "exceeds expectations"-grade I also added the following functions:
- A search bar which dynamically listens for click- and keyup-events
- Number of page links changing based on search search results
- A "No results" message is shown if the search wasn't successful
